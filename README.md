# Coursera_Capstone

In my Capstone Project I will work in the beautiful city of Vienna (Austria). 

My goal will be to show my shareholders -who are interested in the car rental business, but newcomers in Vienna- where to open their first offices. 

This branch is mainly serving the tourists, for that I am going to use some public information of the city service to check the guest arrivals in 2019 for each district in Vienna.

I will use foursquare to check where are the car rental companies located.


At the end I will make a recommendation to the shareholders, in which district they should open their new car rental office.
